Infinite
========

This is my attempt at an implementation of Conway's game of life which is infinite in size

By that I mean:
* no "grid" dimensions are set during initialisation
* you are only limited in size by computational stuff (ie the size of int)

Why is this important? Well, there are two reasons I'd like to write this:
* if we can do this, then we know that similar methods can be used to model particles in physics
* it's actually more in keeping with Conway's original rules - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules
